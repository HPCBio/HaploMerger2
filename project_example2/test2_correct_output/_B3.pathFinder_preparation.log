Species included:  genome_A genome_Ax 
Set the scoring scheme to score, and set the filter score/ali_len to 20000 .
Set to OVER-WRITING mode!
Produce tsc/qsc_ids, total id are 9 !
Read the zeroMinSpace.rbest.net.gz file and do some basic node filtering ...
Total nodes are  21 ;
deleted nodes are 0;
add-up score counts are 0.
To perform advanced node filtering and to produce the final data set of nodes ...
21 left before advanced filtering.
Set filter score/ali_len to 20000 for node advanced filtering ...
1 low-scored nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -2)!
0 embeded nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -4)!
20 nodes left after advanced filtering (no mirror).
Recreate the perfect mirror alignments (nodes) ...
20 nodes left (with mirror).
To produce scaffold portion data structure ...
Cut the scaffold into portions ...
1 target scaffolds have no alignment hit !
1 query  scaffolds have no alignment hit !
Appending infomation of Ns and lowcases to nodes ...
Output the scaffold infomation to genome_A.genome_Ax.result/hm.scaffolds.
Output the scaffold portion infomation to genome_A.genome_Ax.result/hm.sc_portions.
Output the node (alignment block) infomation to genome_A.genome_Ax.result/hm.nodes.
Finished preparation for pathFinder.pl.
