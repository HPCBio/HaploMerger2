Species included:  genome_A genome_Ax 
Set the scoring scheme to score, and set the filter score/ali_len to 200000.
Set the breakingMode to 2,
and set the misjoin_aliFilter to 5000000,
and set the misjoin_overhangFilter to 50000.
--noSelfLoop is set to  1 !
--noStrandConflict is set to 1 !
Set to OVER-WRITING mode!
Finished reading the original data files.
