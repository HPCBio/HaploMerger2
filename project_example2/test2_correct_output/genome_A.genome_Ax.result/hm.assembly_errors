# You may open this file in excel.
# This table shows the potential assembly errors (mis-joins).
# Nodes (alignment) with score or ali_len < 1250000 are not output.
# Sides with at least one overhang shorter than 12500 basepairs are not output.

# You may manually set the breakpoint in the *breakpoint_setting column:
#  0=no manual editing, 
#  1=choose to break the joining point on the target scaffold (tsc), 
#  2=choose to break the joining point on the query  scaffold (qsc).
#  3=choose to break both joining points on the target and query  scaffold (tsc/qsc).

# After editing or updating, this file may be saved as hm.assembly_errors_edited or other names
# in case being overwritten by another invocation of  HM_pathFinder.pl.

# Column ali_len_or_score shows the alignment score.
