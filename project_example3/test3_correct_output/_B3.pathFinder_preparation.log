Species included:  bbv18wm_A bbv18wm_Ax 
Set the scoring scheme to score, and set the filter score/ali_len to 20000 .
Set to OVER-WRITING mode!
Produce tsc/qsc_ids, total id are 10456 !
Read the zeroMinSpace.rbest.net.gz file and do some basic node filtering ...
Total nodes are  35682 ;
deleted nodes are 615;
add-up score counts are 3429.
To perform advanced node filtering and to produce the final data set of nodes ...
35682 left before advanced filtering.
Set filter score/ali_len to 20000 for node advanced filtering ...
8804 low-scored nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -2)!
0 embeded nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -4)!
26878 nodes left after advanced filtering (no mirror).
Recreate the perfect mirror alignments (nodes) ...
22278 nodes left (with mirror).
To produce scaffold portion data structure ...
Cut the scaffold into portions ...
1816 target scaffolds have no alignment hit !
1816 query  scaffolds have no alignment hit !
Appending infomation of Ns and lowcases to nodes ...
Output the scaffold infomation to bbv18wm_A.bbv18wm_Ax.result/hm.scaffolds.
Output the scaffold portion infomation to bbv18wm_A.bbv18wm_Ax.result/hm.sc_portions.
Output the node (alignment block) infomation to bbv18wm_A.bbv18wm_Ax.result/hm.nodes.
Finished preparation for pathFinder.pl.
