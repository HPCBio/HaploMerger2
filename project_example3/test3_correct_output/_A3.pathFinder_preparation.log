Species included:  bbv18wm bbv18wmx 
Set the scoring scheme to score, and set the filter score/ali_len to 100000 .
Set to OVER-WRITING mode!
Set to DELETING mode!
Produce tsc/qsc_ids, total id are 10354 !
Read the zeroMinSpace.rbest.net.gz file and do some basic node filtering ...
Total nodes are  27879 ;
deleted nodes are 152;
add-up score counts are 1780.
To perform advanced node filtering and to produce the final data set of nodes ...
27879 left before advanced filtering.
Set filter score/ali_len to 100000 for node advanced filtering ...
11417 low-scored nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -2)!
0 embeded nodes have been filtered (deletion status value = -4)!
16462 nodes left after advanced filtering (no mirror).
Recreate the perfect mirror alignments (nodes) ...
15292 nodes left (with mirror).
To produce scaffold portion data structure ...
Cut the scaffold into portions ...
2863 target scaffolds have no alignment hit !
2863 query  scaffolds have no alignment hit !
Appending infomation of Ns and lowcases to nodes ...
Output the scaffold infomation to bbv18wm.bbv18wmx.result/hm.scaffolds.
Output the scaffold portion infomation to bbv18wm.bbv18wmx.result/hm.sc_portions.
Output the node (alignment block) infomation to bbv18wm.bbv18wmx.result/hm.nodes.
Finished preparation for pathFinder.pl.
